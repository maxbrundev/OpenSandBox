## Description
OpenSandBox is an OpenGL Framework that provide a ready to go OpenGL development context.

## Framework 
OpenSandBox is based on AmberEngine SDK without the Editor Layer and aim to provide a straightforward OpenGL wrapped API and OpenGL development context systems that can be used to faciliate the user to focus on rendering features.

It will also allow me to easily target the weakness of the AmberEngine API and improve the architecture / rendering features without dealing with the editor side due to a current update.

OpenSandBox also ensure the integrity of a low level usage of the AmberEngine API.
